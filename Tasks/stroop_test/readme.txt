This directory has all the source files for the stroop test.
Run the "stroopex.py" file contains the main source code, while the "stroopex_lastrun" is the same source code with the latest settiings.

STEPS TO RUN THE TEST:
  1) Install all the dependencies from the "dependencies.txt" file.
  2) Open the "stroopex.py" from PsychoPy GUI platform and tune the experiment as required.
  3) To run it you could use GUI or simple execute the source file.
  
NOTE: There will be a lot of errors popping up during setting up PsychoPy. Also, you might want to avoid pip as it doesn't install the GUI platform which makes life easy.
